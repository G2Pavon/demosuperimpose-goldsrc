# demosuperimpose-goldsrc

WIP ghost reimplementation of [demsuperimpose](https://github.com/matthewearl/demsuperimpose) and [demogobbler](https://github.com/lipsanen/demogobbler).

Parser should work as far as its dependency [hldemo-rs](https://github.com/YaLTeR/hldemo-rs) goes. 

## Why

I am not sure. Beside the obvious uplift of compiled executable, [coldemoplayer](https://github.com/jpcy/coldemoplayer) pretty much has already finished all the hard work beside a writer. Bandwagon I think.

## How

Check for files in `src/demo_doer/` to see how to write your own functionality.

## Acknowledgement

Mostly based of these.
