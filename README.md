# demosuperimpose-goldsrc

WIP generally a GoldSrc demo editor.

WIP specifically ghost reimplementation of [demsuperimpose](https://github.com/matthewearl/demsuperimpose) and [demogobbler](https://github.com/lipsanen/demogobbler).

What not WIP is any non netmessage related modification.

Wholistically, only 50% of the work is left but hopefully I think it will only get tedious as soon as I figure out how my delta encode/decode should work.

## Why

I am not sure. Beside the obvious uplift of compiled executable, [coldemoplayer](https://github.com/jpcy/coldemoplayer) pretty much has already finished all the hard work beside a writer. Bandwagon I think.
